# Hi there! 👋

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and all things tech. From hardware to software, I'm enthusiastic about the entire IT ecosystem. Currently expanding my knowledge through my university curriculum while focusing on game development with Unreal Engine 5 and C++.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
I work primarily with C++, Python, and Java, and have dabbled with various other programming languages along my journey. I have good knowledge of all major operating systems including Linux, MacOS, and Windows. My interests span game development with Unreal Engine 5, systems programming, algorithms, and data structures.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I'm focusing on mastering C++ for game development with Unreal Engine 5, while strengthening my computer science fundamentals in algorithms, data structures and game logic. Though I've experimented with different programming languages, I'm now committed to deepening my expertise in C++ for both game and low level systems development.

## 📚 Projects & Goals
I'm currently working on coding challenges and game development projects to sharpen my skills, with aims to create engaging games, contribute to open-source projects, and deepen my knowledge across game development, systems programming, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. I look forward to collaborating with the developer community to learn and share knowledge.
